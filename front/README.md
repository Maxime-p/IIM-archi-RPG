## Dependencies used

### [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)

> Axios is a promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js. It provides a simple and easy-to-use API for making HTTP requests. It also supports the Promise API that is native to JS ES6 which provides a more flexible way to handle asynchronous operations.

### [Jotai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jotai)

> Jotai is a primitive and flexible state management library for React. It allows you to manage both local and global state in a very straightforward way, without unnecessary re-renders.

### [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react)

> React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page. The main purpose of React is to be fast, scalable, and simple.

### [Three.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/three)

> Three.js is a cross-browser JavaScript library and Application Programming Interface (API) used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser. Three.js uses WebGL.

### [React-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom)

> This is a dependency used in our project. It is a collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with your application. It allows us to set up routes to different parts of our application, and helps in creating single page applications. It provides core routing functionality for React Router, but you might not want to install it directly if you are writing an application that will be deployed to the web. You might instead want to install react-router-dom.

# Project structure:
In React, we have the ability to create reusable components such as the navigation bar and various panels. These components can be utilized in multiple ways across different parts of the application, enhancing code efficiency and maintainability.

In the context of React, certain components can be shared and reused across multiple pages. This is one of the key advantages of using React, as it promotes the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. For instance, in the provided code, the `Link` component from `react-router-dom` is used multiple times in different parts of the application to navigate between pages.

Similarly, the `SideBar` component in the `EditScenario` component can be used in other pages as well. This allows for a consistent look and feel across the application, and any changes made to the `SideBar` component will be reflected wherever it is used.

This reusability of components not only makes the code more maintainable and easier to understand, but it also reduces the likelihood of bugs and inconsistencies in the user interface.

### 3 - You'll then need to define your character's code name and choose a profession, each profession has its own skills

![name and skill set](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1220356796305117204/1220363703191343144/image.png?ex=660eab44&is=65fc3644&hm=eb8aa0bc3a1f56d6417c793d4c845338dc2ee98cfaf6146811a6b34b0be0da97&)

### 4 - At the end you will have the recap of your character
